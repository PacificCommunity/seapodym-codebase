## About
SEAPODYM has been initiated in the mid 1990s by the Oceanic Fisheries Programme of the Pacific Community (SPC) and developed under several European development projects. 
The objective was to propose new management tools taking into account both the fishing impact and environmental variability. 
Between 2006 and 2020 its development has continued with the Marine Ecosystem Modeling team of CLS (Collecte Localisation Satellite) in partnership with SPC.
